## Overview

The materials provided here were prepared for a trio of ~three-hour workshops that provide a "crash course" on machine learning in the context of chemistry. The content of the workshops is briefly described below.

### Day 1: Deep Learning in Chemistry
We cover essential elements of machine learning (in general) as well as practical elements on working with deep learning/neural networks and chemical data. Python environments are also set up on this day.

### Day 2: Chemical Representations and Modern Architectures
We cover XXX

### Day 3: Applied Machine Learning in Chemistry and Materials Design
We cover XXX 

### Organizers
The workshops were organized by Michael A. Webb (Princeton University) and Andrew D. White (University of Rochester).

### Additional References
Workshop content heavily draws upon Andrew's book "Deep Learning for Molecules and Materials" (https://dmol.pub/intro.html)
